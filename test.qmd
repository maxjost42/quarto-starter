<!--- This is a comment in Markdown
The above Block defines basic notebook properties namely
format ... defines the output formats generated by quarto render/preview
jupyter ... specifies the python command to use

For html:
code-fold ... specifies if code cells can be folded on the website or not.

For a demonstration of a line plot on a polar axis, see @fig-polar.

```{python}
#| label: fig-polar
#| fig-cap: "A line plot on a polar axis"
# The comments above are cell output formatting instructions for Quarto:
# label ... tells quarto, that the produced figure should be labeled
#           with 'fig-polar' for cross referencing in the notebook
#           (See the @fig-polar above the code cell)
# fig-cap ... tells quarto that the produced figure should have the caption
#             "A line plot on a polar axis"

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

r = np.arange(0, 2, 0.01)
theta = 2 * np.pi * r
fig, ax = plt.subplots(
  subplot_kw = {'projection': 'polar'} 
)
ax.plot(theta, r);
ax.set_rticks([0.5, 1, 1.5, 2]);
ax.grid(True);
plt.show()
